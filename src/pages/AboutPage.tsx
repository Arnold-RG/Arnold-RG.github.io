          Hamwe — “together” — is a Kigali tourism house that sells seats on small, hosted Rwanda
          itineraries. The point is not more options. The point is a group that already has a
          road, a table, and a date.

          <h2>Why strangers</h2>
          <p>
            Solo travelers over-plan. Friend groups under-commit. A circle of ten to fourteen
            people, introduced before the airport, is the size Rwanda’s lodges and gorilla groups
            already prefer. We lean into that.

          <h2>What you buy</h2>
          <p>
            A dated seat. Park fees (including gorilla permits on the tours that list them),
            lodges, a bilingual host, the vehicle, and the meals named in the journal. Flights to
            Kigali are yours.

          <h2>What happens after pay</h2>
          <p>
            You get a ticket. Two weeks out, a circle call. On the ground, a Kigali host keeps the
            days honest. Optional extras — supper, studio, boat — keep mixing the table.

          <h2>Who this is for</h2>
          <p>
            Adults who want Rwanda whole, not a weekend of checkboxes. You do not need to know
            anyone. You do need to sit at a long table and walk at the group’s pace.
