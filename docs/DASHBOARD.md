## Fare architecture

Nothing on the site lists a unit above FRw 80,000. Day tickets stay in the 8–20k band.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
  title "Published fare points (FRw)"
  x-axis ["Meals 8k", "Transport 9k", "Budget day 15k", "Comfort / taxi 20k", "Hosted floor 32k", "Luxury 80k"]
  y-axis "FRw" 0 --> 80000
  bar [8000, 9000, 15000, 20000, 32000, 80000]
```

| Band | FRw | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Floor | 8,000 | Cheapest day ticket |
| Day ceiling | 20,000 | Comfortable / taxi day |
| Hosted tours | 32,000–80,000 | Lodge + host packages |
| Luxury | 80,000 | Full Gathering, Virunga Dawn, luxury day |

## Quality gates

```mermaid

  Push[push to main] --> Tsc[tsc --noEmit]
  Tsc --> Build[vite build]
  Build --> Spa[SPA fallback]
  Spa --> Art[upload dist/]
  Art --> Live[GitHub Pages]
```

- Typecheck is part of `npm run build`, not optional.
- The Pages workflow deploys **only** `dist/`. README, `docs/`, and `.github/` stay on GitHub for reviewers.
- No live secrets. No merchant keys. Checkout is labelled as a demo in the footer.

## Where to look in the code

| Question | File |
| --- | --- |
| Is the desk open in Kigali right now? | `src/lib/hours.ts` |
| Why can a fare not exceed 80k? | `src/lib/format.ts` |
| How does Gisubizo pick an answer? | `src/gisubizo/engine.ts` |
| What tours exist? | `src/data.ts` |
| How does a ticket become an `.ics`? | `src/lib/ticket.ts` |
| What ships to production? | `.github/workflows/pages.yml` |
